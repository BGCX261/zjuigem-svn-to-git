    <h2>Ever-Changing and Indescribable Beauty</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunny or rainy, Hangzhou looks its best in spring. However, the charm of Hangzhou is never tarnished with change of the season. In summer, lotus flowers bloom. Their fragrance brings joy to one's soul and refreshes the mind. Autumn brings with it the sweet scent of osmanthus flowers along with chrysanthemums in full bloom. In winter, the wintry snow scenes can be likened to an exquisite jade carving. Hangzhou's beauty is ever changing but never fails to entice and entrance.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Lake is undoubtedly the most renowned feature of Hangzhou, noted for the scenic beauty that blends naturally with many famous historical and cultural sites. It is like a mirror, embellished all around with green hills and deep caves of enchanting beauty. The Su Causeway which runs from north to south and the Bai Causeway which runs from east to west look like two colored ribbons floating on the water. Hill peaks tower around the lake. Scattered in the adjacent hills are scenic caves and caverns, most of which have many stone sculptures carved on their walls.  Also among the hills one finds springs everywhere.</p>

	<pre><b>So fair is the River's South,
Where pretty scenes did I well know.
The sunrise basks the blooms in fiery glow,
And the spring waters of blue as sapphire flow.
How can my nostalgia cease for the River's Southï¼Ÿ</b></pre>
